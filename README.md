# README for Zaliban Website Repository

Welcome to the Zaliban Website Repository, which contains the source code for the official website of Zaliban, an upcoming game that will be launched on the web 3.

## Web3 Moralis Authentication

This branch of the repository contains the implementation of Moralis authentication for the Zaliban website. Moralis is a backend platform for building decentralized applications that provides secure authentication and account management for players on the web 3. This allows users to sign up and log in to the website with a high level of security and privacy.

In this branch, the Moralis Web3 SDK is used to connect the website to the Ethereum blockchain network. This enables players to interact with the game and its assets directly on the blockchain. The authentication system also allows players to securely manage their assets and transactions within the game.

## Website

The Zaliban website can be accessed at [www.zaliban.com](http://www.zaliban.com). The website is designed to provide a seamless user experience, with an emphasis on visually appealing design and user-friendly navigation. 

The website serves as the main platform for marketing and promoting Zaliban to potential players and interested parties. It contains information about the game, such as gameplay, storyline, characters, and more. It also includes a blog section that provides regular updates on the development of the game, new features, and events.

## Gitcoin Grants and Funding

We are currently seeking funding for the development of Zaliban through Gitcoin Grants. The funds raised will be used to support the development of the game, including the website and other related assets. 

We welcome contributions from the community to help us reach our funding goals. If you would like to support Zaliban, please consider donating to our Gitcoin Grants campaign.
